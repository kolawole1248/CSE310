Hello World Enhanced
Overview
This project represents my first step in building a foundation in software development principles. I created an enhanced "Hello World" application to practice core programming concepts, user interaction, and professional development workflows.

The software is an interactive console application that greets users personally, demonstrates basic programming concepts, and showcases proper code structure. It goes beyond a simple print statement to include user input handling, time-based logic, string manipulation, and error handling.

My purpose for creating this software was to establish a solid understanding of the complete development lifecycle - from writing clean code and documentation to version control with Git and creating professional demonstrations. This project helps me build habits that will scale to more complex software projects in the future.

Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor with the Python extension for enhanced development features. The project leverages Git for version control and GitHub for code repository management.

The program is written in Python 3.11, chosen for its clean syntax, strong community support, and versatility across different application domains. Python's readability makes it an excellent language for learning fundamental programming concepts.
